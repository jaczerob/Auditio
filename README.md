## Download

Download the latest .app release in the GitHub releases.

## Build from source

Extract repo .zip and run `python3 setup.py py2app` in Terminal.

## TODO

Currently there is no nice way to change the clientid besides going into package contents, will probably add some tkinter interface to do that.
